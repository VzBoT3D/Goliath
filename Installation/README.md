# Tips for VzBoT Alu printhead:

- The Goliath is using a nichrome wire to heat up the block. It is quite stiff but also bendable to the desired position. Be ***_extremely_ careful*** when bending. Be gentle and take your time. Put your thumb where the nichrome wire exits the heatblock to hold it in place and avoid the wire going out of the grove, and also to protect it from bending again of the portion that it was bent already, then slowly bend it to desired shape. The best and recommended way to install it on the Vz-Printhead is to mount the heatblock with the PT1000 and Nichrome wire exiting to the to the right side, then bend sligthly up to the back of the printhead.
- There are 3 positions you can use for the heatblock since there are 3 screws/standoffs. So you can rotate the heatblock to your need
- On the Vz-Printhead, you can either send the nichrome wire to the back, under the printhead, or, send it on the right or left side in the front. Sending to the right will keep the "natural" bend of the wire.
- It is recommended to add some thermal paste/grease between the heatbreak and heatsink for better heat transfer. Do not use boron nitride as it will dry and make it really hard to remove heatbreak from heatsink.
- You add a heat insulation sleeve if you like to give more protection of the nichrome wire that sticks out:
- If you run the Vz-Hextrudort CNC version with the Vz-Printhead, the PTFE tube between Goliath and Hextrudort should be 22mm long
- Make sure everything is tighten properly and once you have it mounted and ready, do 2-3 heat cycle then tight the nozzle to 1.5nm (If you do not have a torque wrench, make sure you do not overtight the nozzle to damage thread on the copper heat block)
